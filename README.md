# Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation-by-Backpropagation

This project implements the approach of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation, as described in the original paper Learning Transferable Features with Deep Adaptation Networks by Yaroslav Ganin et al.(https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7495)

Introduction
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a technique that aims to improve a model's performance on a target domain without requiring annotated labels in that domain. This implementation focuses on the backpropagation approach to learn transferable features between a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain.
